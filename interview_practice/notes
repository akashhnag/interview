A callback is a function whick is called after the completion of a task.
or
A callback function is passed as a parameter to a function and runs after the excution
of the first function.

e.g.

fs.readFile('file.txt','utf-8',(err,data)=>{
    if(err){
        throw err
    }else{
        console.log(data);
    }
})

e.g. user defined
function A(callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('This is A.');
        callback()
    }, 3000);
}

function B() {
    console.log('This is B.');
}

A(B);


We use async.parallel when we have to run multiple tasks independent of each other.

syntax: async.parallel(task,callback)

Here, task can be an array, an object or an iterable. The callback excutes after all the 
tasks are complete. It contains the result of all the tasks run before it.
