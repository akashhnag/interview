     we log those exception to log file ( this are catch-able exceptions)
24) API development using other method except get and post
25) difference between N.P.M vs yarn
26) what is package.JSON file and all the sections under it
27) How node process will detect whether this is DEV 
      environment or prod environment and it should use DEV dependency or not
28) while selecting node version there is L.T.S what does  L.T.S stand for 
      ( it is most stable version )
29) How you deal with localization in node ? localization with different language 
30) Sub processes in node
      eg: You need to run binary from the server get o/p of that binary and
31. use it in my node process
32) how do you authenticate and authorize the request
33  when it is made from front end to backed ?

33) different token mechanisms
34) what type of info does J.W.T token contain
 35. what encryption algorithm it is using to encrypt data 
      front end

      benefits / how it works etc.
48) what is SVN and git and in git why we use branches
49) undo code pushed in  branch which is initiated from master branch
     it should be initiated from development branch
50) what is cherry picking, re-base, stashing etc in git
